# Multi-index sequential Monte Carlo ratio estimators for Bayesian inverse problems

This contains the implementation for the examples in the paper "Multi-index sequential Monte Carlo ratio estimators for Bayesian inverse problems" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05351).

Reference：
For 1D example, MLSMC codes are structured based on the MLMC work by Prof. Mike Giles (http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~gilesm/mlmc/#MATLAB).

The 2D PDE solver is modified based on the T-IFISS toolbox by Prof. David Silvester, Prof. Howard Elman and Prof. Dr Alison Ramage (https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/david.silvester/ifiss/default.htm).
